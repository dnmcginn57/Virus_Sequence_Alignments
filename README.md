# Virus_Sequence_Alignments
### David McGinn

## Files
  * `compare.py` - the heart of the project.
  * `common_cold` - A folder pre loaded with genbank files
  * `westnile_zika` - Another folder with some genbank files
  * `hepatitis` - ~~actually this one just gives your computer hepatitis~~ More genbank files
  
 ## Instructions
 from the command line, run the python file with a command like `python3 compare.py <Sequence Path> <Folder Path>`.
 For example `python3 compare.py ./common_cold/rhinovirus_14.gb ./common_cold` make sure the file you link to and the folder
 actually exists(very important)
 
 ## Notes
 This program will work with any genebank file and any folder full of genebank files that you wish to provide the path to.
 Have fun and run it on your own files. Use caution, large files will either cause the program to crash or cause your computer to
 become a space heater.
